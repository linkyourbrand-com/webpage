            <p>Organizing and hosting an event is difficult, time consuming, and frustating.<br/>
                Those in charge already have a lot on their plates, but what is there anything that can be simplified?<br/>
                Of course there is, setting up or paying developer to setup a landing page can be expensive and technically challeging.<br/>
                However, our goal at Link Your Brand is to simply the task of creating a landing page for event organizers.<br/>
                Using a templating system, the creation of a webpage has never been easier and affordable.<br/>
