**Goal:** To help brands and individuals create a professional, all-in-one profile page that serves as a central hub for all their social media links, content, and local events. This web app will allow users to easily manage their digital presence while providing a community-driven feed to discover and connect with local events.

* **Personalized Profile Page:** Each user receives a unique URL (e.g., `LINKYOURBRAND.COM/username`) that serves as a central hub for their links, bio, and social media handles.
* **Simple Content Management System (CMS):** A user-friendly dashboard allows users to easily add, edit, delete, and reorder their links in real-time. This provides a no-code solution for managing their profile content.
* **Dynamic Event Feed:** The platform features a community-driven event feed where users can discover what's happening around them.
    * **Location-Based Filtering:** Events can be filtered by a specific location or city.
    * **Public and Private Events:** Users can create public events visible to all or private events accessible only with a unique invitation code.
* **Responsive UI:** The user interface is designed with a clean color palette (Blue, Grey, White, Black) and is optimized to provide a great experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
